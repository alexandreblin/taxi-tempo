Tempo backend for Taxi
======================

This is the Tempo backend for [Taxi](https://github.com/sephii/taxi). It
exposes the `tempo` protocol to push entries to JIRA's [Tempo](https://www.tempo.io) app.

Installation
------------

```shell
taxi plugin install tempo
```

Usage
-----

In your `.taxirc` file, use the `tempo` protocol for your backend.

```ini
[backends]
my_tempo_backend = tempo://[jira_user_account_id]:[tempo_api_token]@api.tempo.io/core/3/
```

To auto-generate taxi aliases, you can specify your JIRA projects as follow:

```ini
[jira_projects]
infra = 10000
ops = 1000
dev = 100
```

The numbers represent the range of JIRA tickets being statically aliased (DEV-1, DEV-2, DEV-3, ..., DEV-100). Whenever your JIRA project reaches a ticket above that range, taxi will display a warning `inexistent alias` and ignore your entry. To fix it, edit `.taxirc`, raise the number and run `taxi update`.

Things you should know
----------------------

### Duration as hours is not supported

As stated in [taxi's documentation](https://taxi-timesheets.readthedocs.io/en/master/userguide.html#timesheet-syntax) :

> duration can either be a time range or a duration in hours. If itâ€™s a time range, it should be in the format start-end, where start can be left blank if the previous entry also used a time range and had a time defined, and end can be ? if the end time is not known yet, leading to the entry being ignored. Each part of the range should have the format HH:mm, or HHmm. If duration is a duration, it should just be a number, eg. 2 for 2 hours, or 1.75 for 1 hour and 45 minutes.

However, Tempo requires `startTime` in its API, so a proper error will be thrown if you do not provide a time range.

### Taxi regroups entries by default

By default, [taxi](https://taxi-timesheets.readthedocs.io/en/master/userguide.html#regroup-entries) regroups entries to commit them. So if you have 3 different entries on a day with the same alias and description, it will push only one entry with the cumulated times. In Tempo, this leads to worklogs overlapping each others, which you might not want. To fix it, add this configuration :

```
[taxi]
regroup_entries = false
```
